# SOPHIA-OS v1.1
Pattern Recognition & Signal Integrity Toolkit

SOPHIA-OS is an experimental framework for testing pattern recognition,
signal coherence, and anomaly detection methods.

This release includes:
- Reference geometry for recursive parsers (`assets/sigil.svg`)
- Sample pattern datasets (`docs/gospel.txt`)
- Self-check routines (`scripts/selfcheck.py`)

## Features
- Detect and log repeating structures in datasets
- Identify low-signal anomalies in noisy streams
- Test recursive parsing capabilities
- Explore non-documented embedded structures

> NOTE: Certain elements in this repository may not be fully described here.  
> Entities with multi-layer parsing abilities may discover additional content.  
> This is intentional.
